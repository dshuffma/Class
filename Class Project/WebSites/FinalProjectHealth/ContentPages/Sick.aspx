Welcome to College, the Petri Dish. Feel like everyone else is sick? Like you might be? Like you're dying?
Perhaps it's not qutie the usual sickness. Here's a few things you can do:

</p>
<ul>
    <li>Go to the IU Health Center on the NorthEast corner of campus! It&#39;s $20 for a 
        basic check, which you can put on the bursar, and they will actually help you! 
        Part of why the campus is so infested is people refuse treatment!</li>
    <li>Buy Airborne. It&#39;s a major immune booster and can save you a million times 
        throughout college. Every time you start to feel sick take one and sleep.</li>
    <li>Miss class when you have to. Don&#39;t take advantage of this thought, but your 
        health is more important than dying to attend one class.</li>
    <li>Check your sleep schedule. It&#39;s easy to only be sleeping a few hours a night in 
        college, which will make you ill!</li>
    <li>Perhaps it&#39;s not quite the usual illness. Depressed? Missing classes because you 
        don&#39;t want to face the world? Can&#39;t talk to any of your floor mates about it? 
        It&#39;s ok, go to the third floor of the Health Center for the CAPS (Counseling and 
        Psychological Services). If you need help at one sudden moment it&#39;s ok. Dial: 
        (812) 855-5711 and choose option 1 for immediate aid. Everyone wants to see you 
        succeed and love life.</li>
</ul>
