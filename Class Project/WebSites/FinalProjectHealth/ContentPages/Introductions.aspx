    Are you having difficulty making friends at the university? A lot of people do, but here a few tips to
    help you get by. <br />
    <ol>
        <li>Idle chat with the roommate. Easiest to be your best friend if you&#39;re just open.</li>
        <li>Leave the door open. It might seem awkward at first, but there&#39;s always the 
            social people who are happy to reach a hand out to you.</li>
        <li>Going to the store or the food court? Ask people if they want to go on your way 
            out.</li>
        <li>Enjoy the weekends! It&#39;s good to study during the week but there&#39;s always 
            something going on over the weekends. Your floor will go out to parties. Too 
            much? Look for those who like playing games or have similar interests to you. 
            Dorms always have variety.</li>
        <li>College is bigger than a dorm floor. Draft up a list of things you really like 
            to do or always wanted to do. Rock climbing? Dance? Martial arts? Music? 
            Bowling? Indiana University has a club for that and someone near you knows 
            something about it.</li>
        <li>Find clubs your floor mates are in. They&#39;ll be happy to help their club grow and 
            you can gain a lot of new friends in the process.</li>
        <li><a href="http://www.iub.edu/student/activities/clubs.shtml" target="_blank">Look at the list of 
            clubs at IU.</a></li>
    </ol>
<p>
    Indiana University may have a reputation as a party school but you don&#39;t have to 
    be a super outgoing drinker to fit in. Small steps can go miles.</p>
